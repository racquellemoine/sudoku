[Artificial_Intelligence.pdf](https://github.com/racquellemoine/sudoku/files/13047772/Artificial_Intelligence.pdf)

I implemented a backtracking algorithm with forward checking to solve unfinished sudoku boards. sudoku.py writes solution as a string to output.txt.
Program correctly solved all test boards given, run time statistics are as follows.

number of boards solved:  400
total runtime:  14.225624084472656
min runtime:  0.005494117736816406
max runtime:  0.485990047454834
mean runtime:  0.0355614560842514
standard dev:  0.0478496214104503
